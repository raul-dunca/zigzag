# ðŸ’  ZigZag
#### This is a replica of the [zigzag](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.zigzaggame&hl=en_US&gl=US) mobile game. 
- To start the game press `W`. 
- An **infinite random path** is created as you continue the game and every time you press `space` the character changes direction.
- Once in every 10 blocks a **crystal** appears if you collect it your **scores** increases and the game keeps track of your **highest score**. 
- While working at this project I encountered for my first time **animations**.
